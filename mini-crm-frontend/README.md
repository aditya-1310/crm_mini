# Mini CRM Frontend

This is the frontend application for the Mini CRM system.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
   ```
   # Firebase Configuration
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project_id.firebaseapp.com
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project_id.appspot.com
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id

   # API Configuration
   REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
   ```
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server

## Environment Variables

For the application to work correctly, you need to set up environment variables. React requires environment variables to start with `REACT_APP_` to be accessible in the browser.

### Important Notes About Environment Variables:
- Environment variables are loaded at build time, not runtime
- If you change environment variables, you need to restart the development server
- In development, you can use a `.env` file in the project root
- For production, set these values in your hosting environment

To help with debugging, there's a logging system in place that will show if your environment variables were loaded correctly (API keys will be hidden for security).

## Firebase Authentication

The application is currently using Firebase authentication with Google Sign-In. To set up real Firebase authentication:

1. Create a project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Enable Google Authentication in the Authentication section
3. Get your Firebase configuration (apiKey, authDomain, etc.)
4. Add these values to your `.env` file as shown above

## Features

- Campaign creation and management
- Audience segmentation with rule builder
- Dashboard with campaign statistics
- Google OAuth authentication

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
